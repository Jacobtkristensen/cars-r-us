<br> 
    
### ***The idea with, and reasons for why to use, an ORM-mapper***
 
### ***The meaning of the terms JPA, Hibernate and Spring Data JPA and how they are connected***

### ***How to create simple Java entities and map them to a database via the Spring Data API***

### ***How to control the mapping between individual fields in an Entity class and their matching columns in the database***

### ***How to auto generate IDs, and how to ensure we are using  a specific database's preferred way of doing it (Auto Increment in our case for  MySQL)***

### ***How to use and define repositories and relevant query methods using Spring Data JPAs repository pattern***

### ***How to write simple "integration" tests, using H2 as a mock-database instead of MySQL***

### ***How to add (dev) connection details for you local MySQL database***
